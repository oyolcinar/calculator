My first ever "app". Built on March 2022...I guess?

The project was fun to work on and probably gave me a divine clarity on the infamous modus operandi: Learn It By Doing It.

What excited me about this rather mundane programming assignment is the desire to build an old Casio calculator. Like one of those I use to own in elementary school. So I went the extra mile on CSS and tried my hardest to give that *feel* to the user. Something digital yet with an analog, retro feel.

It's crude, it's amateurish and probably amounts to nothing much regarding programming. But I'm still proud of it and find immense joy to play around with it.

Key inputs work and there is a tiny surprise if you try to divide a number by zero.
